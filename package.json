  "description": "AyaPingPing is the `basename` of my starter pack framework for building REST API applications. The goal is to create a simple, clean, and maintainable application environment that also has advantages in performance and security. The first AyaPingPing was made only for building REST API in NodeJS. It was around 2018/2019, when NodeJS became the only one programming language I worked with. But now, I learn and work with some new programming languages. So, I implement AyaPingPing in other programming languages.",
